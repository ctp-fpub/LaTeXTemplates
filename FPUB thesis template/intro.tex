\chapter*{Introduction}

In Chapter \cref{chap:qcd}, some basic concepts of {\sffamily QCD} shall briefly be presented, with focus on gauge transformations and Yang-Mills equations.

Wilson loops on a lattice will be introduced in Chapter \cref{chap:latticeqcd}, as the appropriate degree of freedom for discretising the Yang-Mills action on a lattice without loss of inherent gauge invariance.
