# LaTeXTemplates
LaTeX templates for the students of the Faculty of Physics, University of Bucharest. Current version contains a template for thesis. More features and a template for presentation are under development. 

# Usage

To use this template for your own thesis you will first need to download this repository. You can do that by cloning it via the command line with `git`
```
git clone https://github.com/ctp-fpub/LaTeXTemplates
```
or you can download it using the GitHub user interface by using the "Download ZIP" button

# Brief tutorial

The FPUB thesis template is structured such that each chapter is included in a separate `*.tex` file, where `*` replaces the name of the file. All these are collected in [thesis.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/thesis.tex) with the command `\include{*.tex}`. Each chapter contains a `\label{*}` command, where `*` should be replaced by a custom label. In order to reference a chapter, use `\cref{*}`. The same works for sections, subsections and so on.

#### Style
The style for this template and all custom environments are defined in [ctp-fpub.sty](FPUB%20thesis%20template/ctp-fpub.sty), where all the associated relevant packages are included. In case you want to make changes, feel free to modify the content of this file. 

#### Choosing the main color
Depending on your preference, you may choose a main color which will be used throughout the whole document, for various elements (such as labels, lines, references and many others). This is done in the preamble of [thesis.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/thesis.tex) , by replacing `*` in the command `\def\htmlmaincolorcode{*}` with the HTML code of your desired color. In case you don't prefer this, just make the replacement `\usepackage[black]{ctp-fpub}`.

#### Front page
The title page is coded in [title.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/title.tex) but you just need to fill in the `*` from the definitions found in the preamble of [thesis.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/thesis.tex) as
```
% Information contained in the title page
\def\studentname{*} 
\def\thesistitle{*}
% In case of no subtitle, just leave this field empty {}
\def\thesissubtitle{*}
\def\thesistype{*}
\def\firstsupervisor{*}
\def\firstsupervisorprefix{*}
% In case of no second supervsior, just leave these fields empty {}
\def\secondsupervisor{*}
\def\secondsupervisorprefix{*}
```
and the title page will automatically be generated. This title page is quite basic but in case more elements are required, contact us and we will try to add them to the template.

#### Declaration of authenticity

In a similar manner, the specific [declaration of authenticity](http://www.fizica.unibuc.ro/Fizica/Docs/Dec_plagiat_D.docx) for our faculty, which may be found at [declaratie.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/declaratie.tex) requires your information in the preamble of [thesis.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/thesis.tex) as
```
\def\domeniu{*}
\def\tipteza{*}
```

#### Figures
All figures should be added in the folder [images](FPUB%20thesis%20template/images) and may be included in the document using, for example
```
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=*value*\textwidth]{*filename.extension*}
    \caption{*description*}
    \label{*label*}
\end{figure}
```
This template containes figures generated with [TikZiT](https://tikzit.github.io/) and the file [tikzit.sty](FPUB%20thesis%20template/tikzit.sty), downloaded from an [external source](https://tikzit.github.io/tikzit.sty), is added in the same folder as [thesis.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/thesis.tex). Remove this file if you don't intend to use TikZiT. All the filed generated by TikZiT may be found in the folder [tikzit](FPUB%20thesis%20template/tikzit). A detailed explaination on how to include these files in the document may be found on the [offical website](https://tikzit.github.io/) or by following the commands used in this template.

#### Emphasized equations
Custom defined boxed or shaded environments for equations, with or without labels, are defined in [ctp-fpub.sty](FPUB%20thesis%20template/ctp-fpub.sty). The environment `\boxedeq{*}`, where `*` should contain the equation, creates a box, having a border with the custom color of your choice, around the equation, whereas `\boxedeqlabel{⋆}{*}` can also contain the `⋆` label of the equation. 
The environment `\shadedeq{*}` draws a colored background behind the equation `*`. The shading color may be chosen in `\def\htmlshadecolorcode{*}` from [thesis.tex](FPUB%20thesis%20template/thesis.tex). Similarly, `\shadedeqlabel{⋆}{*}` also labels the equation. Keep in mind that these are constructed using the `equation*` (or `equation` for the labeled versions) environment.

#### Referencing environments
Most commonly used environments such as `align`, `equation`, `figure`, `table` and many others accept the argument `\label{*}`, where `*` is the name of the label. Once a label is set, such an environment may be referenced using `\cref{*}`, which formats the label in a specific way. Alternatively, one may simply use `\ref{*}` and no particular formating is applied.

#### Custom environments
You may also use customized `definition`, `theorem`, `proof` or `remark`, employed via the usual syntax (for example `\begin{definition} ... \end{definition}`). The definitions and theorems are numbered chapter-wise whereas proofs and remarks are unnumbered.

#### Notes
Footnotes may be added via `\footnote{*}`, where `*` should be replaced by the content of the short note. A version with margin notes is currently in progress.


#### Bibliography
The bibliography is contained in [reference.bib](FPUB%20thesis%20template/reference.bib) and requires compiling with `BibTeX`. For example, in Texmaker, the usual compilation sequence is given by `PDFLaTeX + BibTeX + PDFLaTeX + PDFLaTeX`. Once an item is added to the bibiography, it may be cited using `\cite{*}`, with `*` denoting the item's label.
